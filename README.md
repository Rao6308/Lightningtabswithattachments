Lightning component designed to show inline view of related attachments.

Extended the github code (adding files in lightning from peter knolle : https://gist.github.com/peterknolle/bb4b7ac63f67f66c32b0) and created the component to create inline component on any object)

Ideally aiming at making the tabs access the content library instead of the attachment data. This can be configured in the apex controller.
